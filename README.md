playbook
========

This is a playbook for deploying Eucalyptus via packages in accordance with reference Architectures. Depends on ansible 1.3 or above.

The first playbook "dev-test-large" aims to deploy Eucalyptus in a distributed setup per the reference architecture found here:

http://www.eucalyptus.com/eucalyptus-cloud/reference-architectures/dev-test-large  (minus SAN).

These are inventory files, you need to subtitutes the example hostnames with your real system hostnames for each component.

You would then run the playbook with (for example):

ansible-playbook -i dev-test-large-hosts site.yml -u root -k

Add additional options for sudo, ssh key etc. as required.

playbook configuration
========

Note that variables for the installation should be configured in vars/main.yml.  Here you can change the software version, network settings etc.

ansible configuration
========

I've not yet removed all of the deprecated variable definitions, you might want to set this parameter in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg to remove warnings:

deprecation_warnings=False

IMPORTANT NOTE:  Due to some legacy syntax this playbook does not work with 1.6-devel (i.e. from checkout).

You will definitely need this too, for now:

error_on_undefined_vars = False

You might also want to consider (if you rebuild a lot) disabling host key checking by enabling the line:

host_key_checking = False

The file ansible.cfg in the current directory has been provided for this purpose, and should automatically be read
when you execute ansible-playbook. If you do not wish to use this file, rename it or comment out the lines in the file.
